The following is a list of essential tools for securing your Mac computer and encrypting your sensitive data.

Nearly all of these programs are open-source, and they're all highly-regarded.

General System Configuration Tips
=================================

* Make sure your Firewall is on: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642
* Set GateKeeper to only allow installation of apps created by identified developers
* Encrypt your filesystem with FileVault or another tool
* Manage your passwords with a password manager that uses strong encryption algorithm
* Encrypt sensitive emails
* Install well-regarded AV and anti-malware programs. ClamXAV, Sophos are decent free offerings

Disk Encryption
===============

## FileVault (OS X)
Summary:
* FileVault comes pre-installed on Mac OS X Lion and later versions.
* Uses AES-128 bit encryption to protect your startup disk
Docs:
* https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837

## TrueCrypt (Multi-Platform)
Summary:
* A venerable tool for encrypting documents, partitions or your entire filesystem
* On-the-fly encrypt/decrypt without user intervention
* Hidden volume feature allows you to hide a second layer of sensitive content with plausible deniability of existence
* No longer maintained as of 7.1, still popular as of 2015

Public-Key Encryption and Key Management
========================================

## GPG Tools incl. MacGPG (OS X)
Summary:
* Suite of tools using implementation of GnuPG for encrypting communications and files
* Uses symmetric encryption to exchange keys
* GPG Keychain for managing OpenPGP keys
* GPG Services for encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify and import keys from text selections, files, folders etc...

General-Purpose Cryptography
============================

## PGP Impleneted via MacGPG
* GPG Tools (see above) includes MacGPG
* Strong open-source encryption mechanism
* Uses algorithms DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) for authenticating and Elgamal (Also called ELG) for encrypting data
* More about OpenPGP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP

## OpenSSL
* Toolkit implenting SSL/TLS protocols
* Includes full-strength cryptography library
* Symmetric encryption, public key cryptography and key agreement, certificate handling, cryptographic hash functions and a cryptographic pseudo-random number generator
* Symmetric ciphers blowfish, cast, des, idea, rc2, rc4, rc5
* Generate hashed passwords
* RSA utility for generating keys, signing, verifying, encrypting, decrypting and key management
* DSA, PKCS data management
* Generate DSA, Diffie-Hellman parameters
* Z509 certificate data management and verification

Browser Security
================

## Firefox Browser (Multi-Platform)
Summary:
* Firefox is a free, open-source browser created and maintained by the Mozilla community.
* Fewer unknown, unpatched security vulnerabilities than Internet Explorer, Chrome: http://www.securityweek.com/dirty-dozen-list-top-desktop-applications-security-vulnerabilities
* Resource hungry compared to Chrome, Safari but doesn't suffer from security leaks
Important Plugins:
* HTTPS Everywhere: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere
* Ad-Block: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/
* NoScript: https://noscript.net/
* Ghostery: https://www.ghostery.com/en/

Secure Remote Host Access
=========================

## OpenSSH
Summary:
  * Installed on Mac OS X by default
  * Encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network
  * Log into and execute remote commands on a remote machine securely
  * Useful for admins to manage remote systems
  * Secures traffic unlike FTP, replaces it with SFTP
  * Supports 3DES, Blowfish, AES and arcfour as encryption algorithms
  * SFTP Client and Server Support
  * Strong authentication protects against security problems like IP spoofing, DNS spoofing
  * X11 forwarding allows the encryption of remote X windows traffic, so that nobody can snoop on your remote xterms or insert malicious commands.
  * Port forwarding of TCP/IP connections to remote machine over encrypted channel

VPN
===
Note: There's no way to guarantee anonymity with a VPN. Most VPN's log user data in some form, and it's impossible to determine exactly what data they store about your network traffic--even if they say they don't log anything. With that said, VPN's are still useful for protecting your computer from malware, keeping your data private and hiding your location.

## HSSElite

* US-based, so must comply with US Law including Patriot Act
* Good Performance
* Masks IP Address
* Powerful, proprietary encryption algorithm
* Uses its own DNS servers
* Servers in 9 different countries
