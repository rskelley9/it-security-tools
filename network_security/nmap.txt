This file contains in-depth information on NMap. NMap is a powerful network security scanner created by Gordon Lyon a.k.a Fyodor. Free and open source, it's such a valuable contribution to society that it deserves its own text file in this repo.

## What is it and What Does it Do?

  * Powerful multi-platform tool created by a really smart guy, Gordon Lyon
  * Used to detects hosts and services on a network, essentially "mapping" a network
  * It probes by sending specially crafted packets to hosts and then analyzes the subsequent responses
  * It includes a number of useful tools for probing networks, including ping sweeps, OS and vulnerability detection, making it a favorite for hackers and IT security people
  * nmap-services database of more than 2,200 well-known services
  * Port scanning - enumerates open ports on target hosts (useful for auditing)
  * Operating System Detection - determines OS and hardware characteristics of network devices
  * Other info on targets like reverse DNS names, device types, MAC addresses
  * Auditing the security of a device or firewall by identifying network connections which can be made to, or through it
  * Pen Testing - Popular for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities
  * ZenMap GUI, see example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap#/media/File:Zenmap.png
  * Version detection: https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html
