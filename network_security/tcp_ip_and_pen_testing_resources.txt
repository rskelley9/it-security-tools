Network Packet Analysis
-----------------------

WireShark:
  * Requires X11 installed on Mac OS X.
  * Multi-platform, supports OS X, Windows, Linux
  * Includes tshark, a tcdump command-line program
  * Analyze live network data or loaded from capture file
  * Extremely powerful, can set to level of packet detail necessary
  * Rich display filter language and the ability to view the reconstructed TCP session stream
  * Hundreds of protocols and media types supported

TCPDump:
  * Displays network traffic on command line in a raw way, placing analytical burden on human
  * Great learning tool
  * A great primer: https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/

Ettercap:
  * Multi-platform, supports OS X, Windows, Linux
  * Examine traffic from live network connections
  * On-the-fly content filtering
  * Active and passive dissection of numerous protocols including *ciphered protocols*
  * Suite for **man in the middle attacks on LAN**.

Kismet:
* See entry in 'Wireless Discovery' section below

CharlesProxy (Paid):
  * Multi-platform, supports OS X, Windows, Linux
  * HTTP proxy/monitor/reverse proxy
  * Simple program with Beautiful GUI
  * View and record all of HTTP/HTTPS traffic between machine and the Internet, including requests, responses and HTTP headers
  * View plain text SSL requests and responses
  * Has bandwidth throttling to simulate slower connections
  * AJAX debugging to view XML and JSON requests and responses as a tree or as text

Network Security/Intruder Alert
-------------------------------

OSSEC:
  * Source: https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids
  * Downloads: http://www.ossec.net/?page_id=19
  * Full platform for monitoring and controlling system
  * HIDS (host-based intrusion detection)
  * Log monitoring, integrity checking, rootkit detection, time-based alerting and active response
  * In addition to IDS functionality, it is commonly used as a SEM/SIM solution
  * Log analysis engine makes it popular among ISPs, universities and data centers to monitor and analyze their firewalls, IDSs, web servers

Checking Website Security
-------------------------

SkipFish:
 * https://code.google.com/p/skipfish/
 * Skipfish is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. It prepares an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes
 * The resulting map is then annotated with the output from a number of active (but hopefully non-disruptive) security checks
 * The final report generated by the tool is meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application security assessments

Wireless Password Audit
-----------------------

AirCrack:
  * A suite of tools for 802.11a/b/g WEP and WPA cracking.
  * Implementaton of top cracking algorithms to recover wireless keys once enough encrypted packets have been gathered
  * Suite comprises over a dozen discrete tools
  * Includes airodump 802.11 packet capturer, aireplay 802.11 packet injection program
  * aircrack for static WEP and WPA-PSK cracking
  * decrypts WEP/WPA capture files with airdecap


Wireless Discovery
-----------------

Kismet:
  * Console-based (ncurses) tool for 802.11 layer-2 wireless network detection
  * Uses **passive** network identification
  * Includes packet sniffer and intrusion detection system
  * Decloak hidden/non-beaconing networks
  * Detect network IP blocks by sniffing TCP, UDP, ARP, DHCP packets
  * Log traffic in Wireshark/tcpdump compatible format for more in-depth analysis
  * Features for plotting detected networks, estimated ranges on downloaded maps
